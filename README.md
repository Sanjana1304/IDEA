# IDEA
Introducing the Intelligent Digital Educational Assist, an innovative Python application designed to revolutionize the way people engage with education. With a user-friendly GUI built using Tkinter, this application caters to diverse audiences, including individuals with disabilities. For visually impaired users, we provide an exclusive voice assist feature, ensuring equal accessibility for all.

Unlike traditional lecture videos, our application emphasizes interactive learning by increasing visual elements. Users, particularly students, actively engage with modules and progress through lessons, fostering an immersive educational experience. To enhance personalization, the application records user activities, maintaining a comprehensive history page for reference.

We understand the importance of flexibility in learning, which is why we offer a library page. Here, users can curate their own collection of lectures for later viewing, enabling personalized and self-paced learning journeys.

One of the application's standout features is the recommendation system. Leveraging user preferences and past viewing patterns, the system suggests relevant lectures, facilitating discovery of new educational content aligned with individual interests.

The Intelligent Digital Educational Assist combines the power of Python, Tkinter, MySQL, and Excel files to create a robust and versatile platform that empowers learners of all backgrounds. Experience a truly interactive, inclusive, and personalized education with our cutting-edge application.
